Wasting, dissipating all their energy in projection and conjuring up of facade, rather than centering their energy on expanding and broadening their potential or expressing and relaying this unified energy for efficient communication, etc. Maintaining a facade is futile. - The futility of maintaining a facade to act in one way on the surface when actually experiencing something quite different. Being one's self leads to real relationships, and the acceptance of self leads to change. A self-actualising person is a real person. - When a [self-actualising] human being sees another self-actualising person walk past, he cannot help but say hey, now there is someone real!''\n",
